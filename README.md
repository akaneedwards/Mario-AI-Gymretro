# Reinforcement Learning for Nintendo Games

## Team Project G6, S14a, 2020

### Goal
Utilize OpenAI Gym reinforcement learning framework for learning Nintendo platform game. Develop a website to visualize various metrics throughout the training process. In particular, visualize how decisions are made by the framework while training is run and the end result of testing.

### Milestones
* 1st week: Familiarize with OpenAI and game choice and candidate algorithms
* 2nd-3rd week: Game environment development and algorithm tuning
* 2nd-3rd Web pages for visualizing algorithm fitting
* 2-4th week: Visualizations to provide interpretation and insights into trained decision making of the agent
